| **Description** | Documenting a cybersecurity incident|
| **Tool(s) used** | None. |
| **The 5 W's** | -**What:** A ransomware security incident<br>-**Where:** At a health care company<br>-**When:** Tuesday 9:00 a.m.<br>-**Why:** Because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched a ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |
| **Additional notes** | -How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?<br>-Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |

| **Description** | Analyzing a packet capture file |
| **Tool(s) used** | Wireshack |
| **The 5 W's** | -**Who:** N/A<br>-**What:** N/A<br>-**Where:** N/A<br>-**When:** N/A<br>-**Why**: N/A |
| **Additional notes** | I've never used Wireshark before, so I was excited to begin this exercise and analyze a packet capture file. At first glance, the interface was very overwhelming. I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic. |

| **Description** | Capturing my first packet |
| **Tool(s) used** | tcpdump |
| **The 5 W's** | -**Who:** N/A<br>-**What:** N/A<br>-**Where:** N/A<br>-**When:** N/A<br>-**Why:** N/A |
| **Additional notes** | I'm still new to using the command-line interface, so using it to capture and filter network traffic was a challenge. I got stuck a couple of times because I used the wrong commands. But after carefully following the instructions and redoing some steps, I was able to get through this activity and capture network traffic. |

|-------| -------|
| **Description** | Investigate a suspicious file hash |
| **Tool(s) used** | VirusTotal |
| **The 5 W's** | -**Who:** An unknown malicious actor<br>-**What:** An email sent to an employee contained a malicious file attachment with the SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b<br>-**Where:** An employee's computer at a financial services company<br>-**When:** At 1:20 p.m., an alert was sent to the organization's SOC after the intrusion detection system detected the file<br>-**Why:** An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file attachment via e-mail.|
| Additional notes | How can this incident be prevented in the future? Should we consider improving security awareness training so that employees are careful with what they click on? |


### Reflections/Notes
1) Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?
I really found the activity using tcpdump challenging. I am new to using the command line, and learning the syntax for a tool like tcpdump was a big learning curve. At first, I felt very frustrated because I wasn't getting the right output. I redid the activity and figured out where I went wrong. What I learned from this was to carefully read the instructions and work through the process slowly.

2) Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?
After taking this course, my understanding of incident detection and response has definitely evolved. At the beginning of the course, I had some basic understanding of what detection and response entailed, but I didn't fully understand the complexity involved. As I progressed through the course, I learned about the lifecycle of an incident; the importance of plans, processes, and people; and tools used. Overall, I feel that my understanding has changed, and I am equipped with more knowledge and understanding about incident detection and response.

3) Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?
I really enjoyed learning about network traffic analysis and applying what I learned through network protocol analyzer tools. It was my first time learning about network traffic analysis, so it was both challenging and exciting. I found it really fascinating to be able to use tools to capture network traffic and analyze it in real time. I am definitely more interested in learning more about this topic, and I hope to one day become more proficient in using network protocol analyzer tools.
