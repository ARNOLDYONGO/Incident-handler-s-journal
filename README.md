| **Description** | Documenting a cybersecurity incident|
| **Tool(s) used** | None. |
| **The 5 W's** | -**What:** A ransomware security incident<br>-**Where:** At a health care company<br>-**When:** Tuesday 9:00 a.m.<br>-**Why:** Because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched a ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |
| **Additional notes** | -How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?<br>-Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |

| **Additional notes** | I've never used Wireshark before, so I was excited to begin this exercise and analyze a packet capture file. At first glance, the interface was very overwhelming. I can see why it's such a powerful tool for understanding network traffic. |

| **Additional notes** | I'm still new to using the command-line interface, so using it to capture and filter network traffic was a challenge. I got stuck a couple of times because I used the wrong commands. But after carefully following the instructions and redoing some steps, I was able to get through this activity and capture network traffic. |
