| **Description** | Documenting a cybersecurity incident|
| **Tool(s) used** | None. |
| **The 5 W's** | -**What:** A ransomware security incident |
|           | -**Where:** At a health care company |
|           | -**When:** Tuesday 9:00 a.m. |
|           | -**Why:** Because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access, the attackers launched a ransomware on the company's systems, encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. |
| **Additional notes** | How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again? |
|            | Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key? |
